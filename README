Distribution (M) Zero or DMZ is a framework consisting of existing opensource and proprietary technologies which allows users to commoditize their compute, memory,
bandwidth, metadata, behavioral data, carbon offsets and power (in watts). 

The framework can allow or deny the sale of meta and behavioral data to the vendors of the users choice.

The analytic and other products derived from the user owned data can only be consumed by the user (or other users if allowed) through commodity hardware but still 
create an interactive and immersive experience.
